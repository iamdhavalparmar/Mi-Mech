# Mi-Mech
This is an open source project for an application called Mi-Mech
The Mi stands for 'Me' in Spanish and the Mech is the short form of the word Mechanic
I have an Idea to build a project to help the peoples.
I want to connect the mechanic and the customer online, Suppose my car is not working in the middle of a road and I can't find any mechanic near by I can call open this app
find the nearby mechanics and book them to repair my cars.

## This is a completely open source I have an idea and vision and if anyone want to cotribute something little as possible they can.
I'm not new to the Android Develpomenet but I'm new to this CI/CD things and others stuff like testing, So if anyone is interested who knows all this and really want to contribute in this they can ping me. 
Just search iamdhavalparmar and you'll find my contact details
Also I don't really know how to write the propoer readme and the COC etc thigs, So everyone who wants to do this are welcome.
